. **Devastator Doctrine:** The Armour Penetration characteristic of Heavy and Grenade weapons this model is equipped with is improved by 1 whilst this combat doctrine is active.

. **Fire Discipline:** While the Tactical Doctrine is active for your army, INFANTRY models from your army (excluding DEATHWING models) can make attacks with Rapid Fire and Assault Weapons (excluding Blast weapons) while within Engagement Range of enemy units, but must target an enemy unit that is within Engagement Range of its own unit when they do so. In such circumstances, the model can target an enemy unit even if other friendly units are within Engagement Range of the same enemy unit, and while it is making such an attack, it has a Ballistic Skill characteristic of 5+.

. **Grim Resolve:** Each time a model with this tactic makes an attack, unless that model's unit has moved this turn (excluding pile-in and consolidation moves), add 1 to that attack's hit roll. Each time a Combat Attrition test is taken for this unit, it is automatically passed.

. **Implacable:** While the Assault Doctrine is active for your army, each time a DEATHWING INFANTRY or DEATHWING DREADNOUGHT model from your army makes a melee attack against a CHARACTER unit or unit that contains any models with a wounds characteristic if 8 or more, you can re-roll the wound roll.

. **Shock Assault:** Each time this unit fights if it made a charge move, was charged or performed a Heroic Intervention this turn, then until that fight is resolved, add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of models in this unit. 

. **Speed of the Raven:** While the Devastator Doctrine is active for your army:
• Add 3" to the Move characteristic of RAVENWING models from your army.
• RAVENWING units from your army are eligible to shoot with in a turn in which they Advanced. Each time a model in that unit makes a ranged attack in a turn in which it Advanced, that attack suffers the penalty incurred to the hit roll as if firing an assault weapon.

. **Tactical Doctrine:** The Armour Penetration characteristic of Rapid Fire and Assault weapons this model is equipped with is improved by 1 whilst this combat doctrine is active.

 

**++ Selection Rules ++**


. **Angels of Death:** This unit has the following abilities: And They Shall Know No Fear, Bolter Discipline, Shock Assault and Combat Doctrines.

. **Combat Squads:** Before any models are deployed at the start of the game, this unit when containing its maximum number of models, may be split into two units each containing an equal number of models.

. **Death from Above:** During deployment, if every model in this unit has this ability, then you can set up this unit high in the skies instead of setting it up on the battlefield. If you do, then in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement phases you can set up this unit anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from enemy models. 

. **Explodes (6"/D3):** When this model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play. On a 6 it explodes and each unit within 6" suffers D3 mortal wounds. 

. **Inner Circle:** If this unit has the Grim Resolve Chapter Tactic, or it has the Inheritors of the Primarch Successor tactic and it is using the Chapter Tactic of the Dark Angels, then:
• Each time a Morale test is taken for this unit, it is automatically passed.
• While this unit is within Engagement Range of any enemy FALLEN units, unless this unit has the VEHICLE keyword, this unit cannot be selected to Fall Back.
• Each time you select this unit to Fall Back, unless it has the VEHICLE, RAVENWING or CHAPTER MASTER keywords, roll 2D6: if the result is less than or equal to the unit’s Leadership characteristic it can Fall Back, otherwise it cannot Fall Back and must Remain Stationary instead.
• Each time an attack is made against this unit, if this unit has the INFANTRY keyword, an unmodified wound roll of 1-3 always fails, irrespective of any abilities that the weapon or the model making that attack may have.

. **Teleport Strike:** During deployment, you can set up this model in a teleportarium chamber instead of placing it on the battlefield. At the end of any of your Movement phases this model can teleport into battle - set it up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from any enemy models.
